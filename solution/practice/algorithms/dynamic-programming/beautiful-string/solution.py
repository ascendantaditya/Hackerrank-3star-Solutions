# This problem is just counting how many ways there are to
# remove the two characters. For this, we can group the string
# by character, and after that either we remove two characters
# from two groups, or both from one group.
#
# There's one potential duplication we have to remove: if a group
# has size 1 and two groups around it have the same character
# (e.g. 'aaabaaaaa'), and we pick one from the middle group, it
# doesn't matter which of the two side groups we pick from, so
# we have to subtract 1 for each of this pattern.
