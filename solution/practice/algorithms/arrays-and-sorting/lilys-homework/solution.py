# First we should notice that sum(|a_i - a_j|) >= max(a) - min(a).
# Left and right are equal if and only if a is sorted (in either order).
#
# When we sort an array, we are essentially doing a permutation (See
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Permutations_in_group_theory).
# The permutation can be broken down into n-cycles and further into swaps.
# We need (n - 1) swaps for each n-cycle in the permutation. Therefore, 
# in our code we will find each of the n-cycle and sum up all of them.
