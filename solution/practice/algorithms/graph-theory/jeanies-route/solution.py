# Welp. I had tried my best, but this challenge needs so many steps 
# and thus is quite verbose to write. I will try to make myself clear.
#
# First we notice that the edges used are always the same no matter
# where we start or finish. These paths form a subtree of the original
# graph (which is the smallest subtree containing all the delivery cities).
#
# When we start and finish at the same city, the total distance is always
# twice of the sum of all paths in the said subtree. And when we start
# and finish in different cities, the distance should subtract the path
# between these two cities. Thus we must maximize the distance between
# the starting city and the finishing city.
#
# Using Dfs will greatly simplify the code. But the N seems too huge to
# do the recursion properly. Maybe next time.
#
# So here's what to do:
# 1. Find the said subtree
# 2. Find the longest path in it
# 3. Do the subtraction
#
# Time complexity: O(N)
