# There are 3 situations that we should print 'YES':
# * The string is valid by itself (e.g. 'aaabbbccc')
# * The string is a valid string plus a new character (e.g. 'aaabbbcccd')
# * The string is a valid string plus an existing character (e.g. 'aaaabbbccc')
# And we will leave it to collections.Counter to do its magic.
