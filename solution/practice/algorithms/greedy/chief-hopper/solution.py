# If the energy at each building i is e[i], we notice that
# all e[i] will go up if we increase the initial energy, and
# all e[i] will go down if we decrease it. Since it's impossible
# for e[i] to recover from a negative value, when we set the final
# energy to zero, we can be sure that the energy will be positive
# all the way through the N buildings, and the initial energy must
# be minimized.
